# Riemannian notation — post-Curvature tier

Notations for quantities defined in `Curvature.lean`, `Gradient.lean`,
`SecondFundamentalForm.lean`. This file imports those math files and
must therefore NOT be imported back by them — it sits strictly
downstream of the curvature math layer.

  * `Ric(X, Y)`         — `ricci X Y` as a section
  * `Ric_g(v, w) x`     — `ricciTensor x v w` (pointwise)
  * `II(X, Y)`          — `secondFundamentalFormScalar X Y` (codim-1)
  * `scal_g[I]`         — `scalarCurvature (I := I)` ($M \to \mathbb{R}$)
  * `H_g[I]`            — `meanCurvature (I := I)` ($M \to \mathbb{R}$)
  * `grad_g[I] f`        — `manifoldGradient (I := I) f` as a section
  * `gradNormSq_g[I] f`  — `manifoldGradientNormSq I f` ($|\nabla f|^2_g$)
  * `Δ_g[I] f`           — `Operators.scalarLaplacian (I := I) f`
  * `hessNormSq_g[I] f`  — `Operators.hessianSqNorm (I := I) f` ($|\nabla^2 f|^2_g$)

The Riemann curvature notation `Riem(X, Y) Z` lives in
`Util/Notation/Riemann.lean` so that
`Curvature.lean` itself can use it.

`I` (the model with corners) appears explicitly in the bracketed
operator notations because `f : M → ℝ` and bare `M` do not expose
`I` to typeclass synthesis (REFACTOR_PLAYBOOK §5). For operators
on tangent fields (`Ric`, `Ric_g`, `II`), `I` is recovered from the
field's `TangentSpace I x` type and the bracket is unnecessary.

All `scoped` to `Riemannian`. Eta-reduced for simp-friendly elaboration.

**Ground truth**: do Carmo 1992 §4 (Ricci), §6.2 (second fundamental
form, mean curvature).
